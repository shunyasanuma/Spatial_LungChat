## Visium_HD_pre-processing
Here we describe a series of analyses of Visium HD cell type annotation.

### Outline
#### 1. Subset
This Jupyter Notebook, [`Crop_high_resolution_microsope_image.ipynb`](./01.Crop_high_resolution_microsope_image.ipynb), demonstrates how to:
- Load and visualize high-resolution microscope `.tif` images.
- Crop regions of interest (ROIs) based on coordinate inputs.
- Save the cropped output for downstream spatial analysis (e.g., Cell type annotation, Visium HD - Xenium alignment).
- Optionally, batch-process multiple crops with consistent metadata.
